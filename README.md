# Worktree

Worktree is a tool for creating ZK airdrops claimable by Github contributors, inspired by Element's contributor ecosystem airdrop.

Portions of this code are built on Element's [ZK contracts](https://github.com/element-fi/elf-council-zkcontracts) and [frontend](https://github.com/element-fi/frontend-monorepo).
